## 📌 Project Overview
This analysis identifies key opportunities for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, to unlock new growth strategies. By analyzing smart device fitness data, I discovered trends in user activity, sleep, and stress management.

* **Sedentary Habits:** Users spend an average of **16.5 hours** sedentary per day, which negatively impacts sleep quality.
* **Activity Gap:** The majority of users are "Lightly Active" and fail to reach the recommended 10,000 steps.

* Correlation Heatmaps (Sleep vs. Activity)
* Scatter Plots (Calorie Burn Intensity)
* Daily Activity Bar Charts
